#### .Net core is :

1. Open Source:
   
   -- Open source software (OSS) is software that is distributed with its source code, making it available for use, modification, and distribution with its original rights. 
   -- Source code is the part of software that most computer users don’t ever see; it’s the code computer programmers manipulate to control how a program or application behaves.      -- Programmers who have access to source code can change a program by adding to it, changing it, or fixing parts of it that aren’t working properly.
   -- Open source code is usually stored in a public repository and shared publicly. Anyone can access the repository to use the code independently or contribute improvements to the design and functionality of the overall project.
